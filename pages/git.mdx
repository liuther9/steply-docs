# GIT

## Branches
For every new change a temporary new branch must be created. 

The name of the branch must be in form:

```[category]/[ticket id]/[description]```

### Category
Must be one of the following:

```feature``` is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature

```bugfix``` is for fixing a bug

```hotfix``` is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)

```experimental``` is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

### Ticket id
A ticket id referencing specific task from Jira, for example: LEON-11

If there is no ticket, insert no-ref

### Description
After the reference, there should be another ```"/"``` followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased".

### Examples:
You need to add, refactor or remove a feature: git branch ```feature/issue-42/create-new-button-component```

You need to fix a bug: ```git branch bugfix/issue-342/button-overlap-form-on-mobile```

You need to fix a bug really fast (possibly with a temporary solution): ```git branch hotfix/no-ref/registration-form-not-working```

You need to experiment outside of an issue/ticket: ```git branch experimental/no-ref/refactor-components-with-atomic-design```

## Commits
A commit must follow the following form:

```[category]: [statement]; [statement] [...]```

### Category
A commit message should start with a category of change. You can pretty much use the following 4 categories for everything: feat, fix, refactor, and chore.

```feat``` is for adding a new feature

```fix``` is for fixing a bug

```refactor``` is for changing code for performance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)

```chore``` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)

After the category, there should be a ```":"``` announcing the commit description.

### Statement(s)
After the colon, the commit description should consist in short statements describing the changes.

Each statement should start with a verb conjugated in an imperative way. Statements should be separated from themselves with a ```";".```

### Examples
```git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add new button components to templates'```

```git commit -m 'fix: add the stop directive to button component to prevent propagation'```

```git commit -m 'refactor: rewrite button component in TypeScript'```

```git commit -m 'chore: write button documentation'```

## Hooks
Project uses ***Husky*** on commits and pushes:

Runs ```yarn lint``` on commits and ensures that there are no ESLint errors

Makes sure the commit message is written in the format described above

Runs ```yarn build``` on git pushes and makes sure that there no build errors
