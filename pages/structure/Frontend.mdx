# Frontend

## Main Stack


***src/*** - is Entry point basically for everything

***app/*** - folder is where routing starts

You can create folders like ***_widgets***, ***_components***, ***_features***, ***_types*** etc inside related routes

**Feature Sliced Design** - is the design pattern we will be following, though not strictly :)

All components/widgets etc related to particular logic should be placed inside _components/ folder or _widgets/ inside that route folder linked to this logic.

src/utils is where Supabase Provider lies. Might be reconsidered later

All shared components/utilities/hooks/types without any business logic should be placed inside src/shared/[folder] folder

Typical component template is '[Component]' folder with index.tsx
