# Frontend

## Main Stack


```src/``` - is Entry point basically for everything

```app/``` - folder is where routing starts

You can create folders like ```_widgets```, ```_components```, ```_features```, ```_types``` etc inside related routes

**Feature Sliced Design** - is the design pattern we will be following, though not strictly :)

All ***components or widgets*** etc related to particular logic should be placed inside related folder starting with ```_``` for example
```auth``` folder (route) - might have its own ```_components``` folder

Other widgets, entities, features that are reused in different routes might be placed in ```src``` directory

```src/utils``` is where Supabase Provider lies.

All shared ***components, utilities, hooks, types*** without any business logic should be placed inside ```src/shared/[folder]``` folder

Typical component template is ```[ComponentName]/index.tsx```
